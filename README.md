This Project is aimed to employ basic machine learning techniques to accurately categorize different species of Iris. In this project I applied Logistic Regression algorithm on the dataset called iris.csv by Kaggle. This project shows step-by-step process of model creation, training, evaluation, generating prediction results, and testing the best model on new data.
